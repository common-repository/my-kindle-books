Show off your favourite Kindle books and make money doing it, by adding a book list page on your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

If you are anything like me you'd love to see the books that your favourite bloggers are reading, that's why I built this plugin that hopefully they'll all use.

The reward for sharing your books is money, just add your Amazon affiliate tags, and make money everytime a user clicks on one of your books, and then buys it from the Amazon store.

After installing My Kindle Books, simple go to it's admin page to add your books. This is done by simply connecting your kindle, then browsing it's documents folder that contains all the books on your Kindle, then selecting your favourite books.

Once your books have been selected we then take the ISBN numbers from your selected books and send them to our central server, we then get the title, author and cover images for each of your books.

This information is then displayed on the admin page and you can move the order of your books by dragging them, or remove them from the list by clicking the delete button.

To add new books just click the browse button again select your new books, and they then will be added to your list.

If you want to make money when users click on your books, and then purchase them from the Amazon store, you will need to add your Amazon affiliate tags, in the "Affiliate tags" admin page. To get affiliate tags just go to the Amazon store for each country mentioned on the admin page, and fill out the online application.

A new page will now be created called "My Kindle Books", this page is a table of your books.

Each time this page is visited a small request is made to our central server that returns the Country the user is connecting from. This information is then used to update the Amazon link, for example if the user is from Canada there is no point giving him a link to the German store, also we update the affiliate tag as you'll need a different tag for each country.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `/my-kindle-books/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the My Kindle Books admin page, plugin your Kindle and select your favourite books from the documents directory

== Frequently asked questions ==

One of my books is not showing up?

Sometimes Amazon changes the ISBN number of a book, go to Amazon and download a sample of the latest version of that book and upload that one instead.
